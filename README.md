## Scenario 3
### Ruby and Wildfires 
* Ruby is an undergraduate student in Los Angeles. During her time at school, the Los Angeles area has experienced many fires. Some being very dangerous and had some student evacuate the campus. Ruby is from out of state, so she is not used the the fire experience as many people on the west coast are. These fires have been very scary for her and anxiety inducing. She recently discovered weather.gov and saw that she could see information on fires in her area. 
* Ruby wants to look at the fires and any warnings in her area to be prepared for the future. Ruby navigates to “Safety” at the top of the page, she then gets to a page with a lot of icons, she finds “wildfires” and clicks on that. She is then taken to a page with a small box for images and there is a strip of tabs at the top that has options for her to click on. She finds “Watch vs. Warning” and clicks on this. When clicking on that, a new map comes up of the US with different sections colored based on watch or warning. The map is easy to read and the colors make sense. To exit, Ruby click on the “Home” tab and it take her back to the page that appeared when she logged on. She exits the website easily knowing that her area is not under fire watch or warning.
