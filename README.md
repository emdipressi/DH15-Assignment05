## Scenario 1
### Lola and the Drought 
* Lola is a third grade teacher, but also someone who is concerned about her locations drought. She knows that she lives in the desert, which sometimes does not receive a lot of rain, but this past winter and spring brought a lot of rain. As a curious environmentalist who wants to bring some fun facts to her science lesson at school, she wants to know if the drought conditions have improved. In her older age, Lola is not too keen on computers. Certain things are too complicated; she likes a website that has succinct information without extra fluff or distractions.
* Wanting an official site, Lola logs into weather.gov one night. She successfully finds “Drought” both in the hover dropdown menu and when she clicks on “Safety” and everything is in alphabetical order. Upon clicking “Drought” she is taken to a page that has a box for images and smaller tabs on top of it and extra resources on the side. Lola clicks on “Monitoring, Forecasts” and the page changes slightly to have a different image and a widget from “drought.gov" where she can type in her zip code and get the drought information for her location, while still on the weather.gov site. If she wanted more detailed information on droughts she would click on a tab in the “Drought Resources” section on the side of the page, but for now she wants a not complicated answer to share with her class.

## Scenario 2
### Clark and Temperature 
* Clark, a single dad, is in charge of getting his kids ready for school. He has three young children and mornings are hectic. In the past he has sent his kids to school without rain jackets because it didn’t look like it would rain, but then the weather changed and his kids were soaked because they didn’t have jackets, boots, or umbrellas. Clark felt responsible for his kid’s lack of preparedness. He wants to do better for his kids and find hourly weather reports and precipitation.
* Clark navigates to weather.gov Monday morning before he wakes the kids up. To find the hourly weather report for his area, he first types in his zip code in the top left box where local forecast is clearly labeled. Upon entering his zip code he is taken to a page that has his current weather and  some extra information is given such as humidity and precipitation percentage. He finds “hourly weather forecast” under the tab labeled “more information”. He clicks that and is taken to a page of the same design. He is presented with a large, readable graph that has temperature clearly marked out each hour in a color that he can see. He happily leaves the site and leaves with knowing how the days temperature will change along with the chance of rain. He is able to dress his children appropriately.

## Scenario 3
### Ruby and Wildfires 
* Ruby is an undergraduate student in Los Angeles. During her time at school, the Los Angeles area has experienced many fires. Some being very dangerous and had some students evacuate the campus. Ruby is from out of state, so she is not used the the fire experience as many people on the west coast are. These fires have been very scary for her and anxiety inducing. She recently discovered weather.gov and saw that she could see information on fires in her area. 
* Ruby wants to look at the fires and any warnings in her area to be prepared for the future. Ruby navigates to “Safety” at the top of the page, she then gets to a page with a lot of icons, she finds “wildfires” and clicks on that. She is then taken to a page with a small box for images and there is a strip of tabs at the top that has options for her to click on. She finds “Watch vs. Warning” and clicks on this. When clicking on that, a new map comes up of the US with different sections colored based on watch or warning. The map is easy to read and the colors make sense. To exit, Ruby click on the “Home” tab and it take her back to the page that appeared when she logged on. She exits the website easily knowing that her area is not under fire watch or warning.
